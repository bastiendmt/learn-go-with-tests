# Lean Go with tests

## Learn test-driven development with Go

- Explore the Go language by writing tests
- Get a grounding with TDD. Go is a good language for learning TDD because it is a simple language to learn and testing is built-in
- Be confident that you'll be able to start writing robust, well-tested systems in Go

## Discipline

- Write a test
- Make the compiler pass
- Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
- Write enough code to make the test pass
- Refactor
